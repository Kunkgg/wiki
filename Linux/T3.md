# T3 -- Reset lost root password

## Using GRUB to invoke bash

1. Select the appropriate boot entry in the GRUB menu and press `e` to edit the line.
1. Select the kernel line and press `e` again to edit it.
1. Append `init=/bin/bash` at the end of line.
1. Press `Ctrl-X` to boot (this change is only temporary and will not be saved to your menu.lst). After booting you will be at the bash prompt.
1. Your root file system is mounted as readonly now, so remount it as read/write `mount -n -o remount,rw /`.
1. Use the passwd command to create a new root password.
1. Reboot by typing `reboot -f` and do not lose your password again!
