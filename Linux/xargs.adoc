xargs - build and execute command lines from standard input

The xargs command reads lines of text from the standard input or from the
output of another command and turns them into commands and execute them.

Youâ€™ll often `find` `xargs` command being used with the `find` command.
The find command gives you a list of filenames and the xargs command lets you
use those filenames, one by one,
as if it was input to the other command.

xargs command has the following syntax:

[source]
xargs [options] [command [initial-arguments]]

=== Options

-t, --verbose::
    Print the command line on the standard error output before executing it.
-p, --interactive::
    Prompt whether run or not run each command line.
-I replace-str::
    Use replace-str. e.g. -I {}

=== Examples

.See what command is being executed
[source]
find . -type f -name "*.txt" | xargs -t touch

.Force xargs to prompt for confirmation before running the command
[source]
find . -type f -name "*.txt" | xargs -p rm

.Using placeholder with xargs to get more control over it
[source]
find . -type f -name "*.txt" | xargs -p -I {} mv {} new_dir

.Running multiple commands with xargs
[source]
find . -type f -name "*.txt" | xargs -I {} sh -c 'ls -l {}; du -h {}'

.Using xargs with docker
[source]
docker ps -q | xargs docker stop

[TIP]
Dealing with file names with spaces in `find` command result by `-print0`
option, e.g. +
`find . -type f -print0 -name "*.txt" | xargs -0 grep -l red`
