== Issues

.No matching key exchange method found by OpenSSH 7.0
OpenSSH 7.0 deprecated the diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key algorithm because it
is weak and within theoretical range of the so-called Logjam attack
(see http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html).
If the key algorithm is needed for a particular host,
ssh will produce an error message like this:

[source]
----
Unable to negotiate with 127.0.0.1: no matching key exchange method found.
Their offer: diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
----

The best resolution for these failures is to upgrade/configure the server to
not use deprecated algorithms. If that is not possible,
you can force the client to reenable the algorithm with the client option:

.client side `~/.ssh/config`
