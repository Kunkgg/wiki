# T4 -- Make USB flash installation media

## Using dd

1. Find out the name of USB drive with `lsblk`.
Make sure that it is not mounted.
2. Run the following command,
replaccing `/dev/sdx` with your drive, e.g. `/dev/sdb`.
(Do **not** append a partition number,
so do **not** use something like `/dev/adb1`)

```sh
# dd bs=4M if=path/to/some.iso of=/dev/sdx status=progress oflag=sync
```

**Warning**: This will irrevocably destroy all data on `/dev/sdx`.
